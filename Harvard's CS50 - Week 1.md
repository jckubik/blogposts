While browsing edx.org last weekend, I came across a two-course program offered by Harvard called "Computer Science for Web Programming" (you can find it here: https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-web-programming). 

The first of these classes is CS50s Intro to Computer Science which I had heard of before, so I decided to take a stab at it myself and take the course.

The class is broken down into 8-week sections with each week having lectures and projects. The first week, week 0, was about the very basics of programming through a project using MIT's Scratch (scratch.mit.edu).

We had to make a project using Scratch that met specific requirements, and I decided to make a game. 

My game, Don't Break My Hearts (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/454232525), is a paddle-based defender game. The goal is to move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys to defend the hearts at the bottom of the screen from the other suits' cards as they fly around everywhere. 

I created 4 different types of card projectiles to defend against with unique properties:

 - Normal suit cards: These were the basic type of cards. They just flew and bounced around the screen.
 - King of Diamonds: This card clones itself whenever it destroys one of the player's hearts.
 - Queen of Spades: For this special card, I made the speed 4 times that of the other cards.
 - Jack of Clubs: Finally, the Jack hides and unhides itself every-so-often.
 
I also created two boosts that fell randomly throughout the game. If you caught them with your paddle, you got one of two perks:

 - healthPot: Catching this boost gave you back one of your hearts.
 - slowPot: This boost slowed down the cards making it easier to defend against them.
 
The cards get progressively faster over time, and once all of your hearts are destroyed, the game ends. I think that if I added to the game in the future I would add in a way to keep score as there isn't really one already. There's a way to lose, but there's not a way to win. I think adding a timer would be the best way to show a score. Then players would be able to shoot for longer and longer times as they played. 

Adding more variations of the cards and the boosters would be another way to add to the game. Another boost idea would be one that somehow made the paddle longer. Even adding negative effects would be a great addition as well. 

All in all, I'm pretty happy with what I created for the first project and I can't wait to continue to learn more in the course.
